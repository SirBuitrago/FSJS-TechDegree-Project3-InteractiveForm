# TechDegree-Project3-Interactive-Form


Project 3 of the Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree.

A simple interactive form site for a mock conference - that checks for valid input of creditentials. Such as name, email, phone-number, address and credit card information. It also has a drop down style menu, for t-shirts associated with that conference. The styles change depending on the size of the shirts.

For individualizing the project, I added a code snippet that gave the "full stack" header a neon sign glow - that emits a hue every few seconds. As well as changed the background to a brick pattern.
